% If you would like to post an early version of this manuscript as a preprint, you may use preprint as the journal and change 'submit' to 'accept'. The document class line would be, e.g., \documentclass[preprints,article,accept,moreauthors,pdftex]{mdpi}. This is especially recommended for submission to arXiv, where line numbers should be removed before posting. For preprints.org, the editorial staff will make this change immediately prior to posting.

\abstract{A method for simulating the spread of wildfire over complex terrain is presented. An immersed boundary method (IBM) is used to render the complex terrain on a rectilinear Cartesian grid. Fire spread is modeled using one of three basic approaches: (1) representing the vegetation as a collection of Lagrangian particles, (2) representing the vegetation as a semi-porous boundary, and (3) representing the fire spread using a level set technique in which the fire spreads as a function of terrain, vegetation type, and wind speed.}

\section{Introduction}

The work of Mell et al.~\cite{Mell:IJWF2007}.


\section{The Mean Forcing Concept}

The process of steering the solution of the mass, momentum, and energy equations to match wind speed and direction gathered at random weather stations is known as \emph{data assimilation}~\cite{Kalnay:2003}. FDS uses a relatively simple data assimilation technique, a method known as \emph{nudging}, where you add a forcing term to the momentum equation to ``nudge'' the flow in the direction of the specified wind. FDS automatically drives the mean velocity components toward the desired values by adding a forcing term to the momentum equation. For example, the $u$ component equation is modified as follows:
\begin{equation}
   \frac{\partial u}{\partial t} + \ldots = \frac{u_0(z,t)-\overline{u}(z,t)}{\tau} \label{mean_forcing_u}
\end{equation}
Here, $u(\mathbf{x},t)$ is the computed velocity component, $u_0$ is the specified wind field component that can vary with height and time, and $\overline{u}$ is the average of the computed velocity component at the height $z$. The relaxation time scale, $\tau$, is an important parameter. The shorter this time scale, the faster the flow field will ``catch up'' to the mean wind, but at the expense of possibly washing out important flow structures. There is no firm guidance in the atmospheric modeling literature.

\section{Wildland Fire Spread}

There are three ways of simulating wildland fire spread.

\begin{enumerate}
\item {\bf Particle Method:} The vegetation is represented by a collection of Lagrangian particles that are heated via convection and radiation.
\item {\bf Boundary Fuel Model:} Ground vegetation is modeled like a porous solid with a thickness equal to the height of the vegetation.
\item {\bf Level Set Method:} The fire front propagates using purely empirical rules.
\end{enumerate}
The Particle Method and Boundary Fuel Model require thermo-physical properties of the vegetative fuels and the fire spread rate is {\em predicted} by the model. The Level Set Method relies on a set of experimentally-determined spread rates for different types of vegetation and wind speeds.
